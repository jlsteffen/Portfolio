# Analytics Portfolio - Josh Steffen

This page contains links to and a summary of the projects I have worked on for my acedemic career and for my personal interest. 

## Projects

MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) is an integral field spectrocopic survey which has observed ~10,000 nearby galaxies. While the survey's target objects are accounted for, there are many other astronomical objects that may fall within the survey's fields-of-view. The goal of this project is to identify and catalog all ancillary targets found within the MaNGA survey.

The goal of this project is to study how galaxy mergers influence star formation within the galaxies. I find that galaxy mergers induce increased star formation in the centers of the galaxies. I then study how various galaxy merger properties influence the enhanced star formation. I find that closely separated mergers and galaxy mergers with similar masses show the high enhancements to their star formation. I also find that in galaxy mergers where the two galaxies have substantially different masses, the less massive galaxy has suppressed star formation in their disks while the more massive galaxy has enhanced star formation in their disks.
