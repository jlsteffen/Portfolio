# Analytics Portfolio - Josh Steffen

This page contains links to and a summary of the projects I have worked on for my academic career and for my personal interest. 

## Academic Projects

MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) is an integral field spectroscopic  survey which has observed ~10,000 nearby galaxies. While the survey's target objects are accounted for, there are many other astronomical objects that may fall within the survey's fields-of-view. The goal of this project is to identify and catalog all ancillary targets found within the MaNGA survey.

The goal of this project is to study how galaxy mergers influence star formation within the galaxies. I find that galaxy mergers induce increased star formation in the centers of the galaxies. I then study how various galaxy merger properties influence the enhanced star formation. I find that closely separated mergers and galaxy mergers with similar masses show the high enhancements to their star formation. I also find that in galaxy mergers where the two galaxies have substantially different masses, the less massive galaxy has suppressed star formation in their disks while the more massive galaxy has enhanced star formation in their disks.

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) occurs when a galaxy's central supermassive black hole accretes large amounts of material and subsequently radiates a large amount of high energy photons. How the central supermassive black hole receives this material has been a major question. One possible theory is that the black hole receives this material from gas-inflows induced by the merging of galaxies. In this project, I use my sample of merging galaxies within the MaNGA survey to see if the merging galaxies statistically host more AGN than isolated galaxies.

**[My Python Library](https://github.com/jlsteffen/python-functions)**

A set of three python modules that I have written and used in my work. One module contains generic statistical and astronomical functions, another contains plotting utilities in Matplotlib, and the final one contains functions for calculated astronomical metallicity.

## Personal Projects

I practice with the Tableau application while addressing questions regarding changing tornado pattern in the United States. Here I discover that the United States is observing more low magnitude tornadoes but fewer high magnitude tornadoes than previously observed in the past few decades. Also, the center of tornado valley has been shifting eastwards for the past three decades.
